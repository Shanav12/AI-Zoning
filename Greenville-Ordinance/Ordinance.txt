CODE OF ORDINANCES TOWN OF GREENVILLE, FLORIDA


--------------------------------------------------
GREENVILLE OFFICIALS


This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the
            Town of Greenville, Florida.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances of a permanent
            and general nature adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included
            in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such
            a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the
            adoption of the Code.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and
            the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.
            Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant
            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting
            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used
            in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts
            separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and
            the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.
            Thus, the second section ofchapter 1is numbered 1-2, and the first section ofchapter 6is6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same
            time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system
            for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would
            logically come between sections6-1and6-2is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and
            new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be
            placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions,
            may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive
            number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included
            by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical
            arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the
            left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.
            The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.
            In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates
            the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately
            to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical
            parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,
            and their corresponding prefixes:
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has
            been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology,
            others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local
            government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the
            indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular
            item in which the user is interested.
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental
            servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to
            date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected
            page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of
            copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages
            and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder
            of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility
            of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.
            It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately
            upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be
            saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
This publication was under the direct supervision of Mollie M. Garrett, Code Attorney,
            and Amanda Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.
            Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their
            sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Kimberly Reams, Town Clerk, Edward W. Dean, Town
            Manager, and John Reid, Esq., Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance
            during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts
            and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the
            active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable
            tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

               official acts are to be taken, and shall control any gathering or meeting of two (2)
               or more Town Council members at which there is discussion of some matter which will
               foreseeably come before the Town Council. Except as provided in the Florida Sunshine
               Law, all such meetings are public meetings, open to the public at all times, and no
               formal action shall be considered binding except as taken or made at such meetings.
The Town Council shall meet in regular meetings once per month, and at such special
               meetings as are called pursuant to town policy.

No Town Council member present at any public meeting may abstain from any vote, and
               votes shall be recorded for each such Town Council person present, unless, with respect
               to any Town Council member, there is or appears to be a possible conflict of interest,
               or if a quasi-judicial proceeding by the Town Council, a Town Council member must
               abstain to assure a fair and unbiased proceeding. In either case, the affected Town
               Council member shall abstain in accordance with the procedures set forth in section
               112.3143, Fla. Stat. The remaining Town Council persons, as long as a quorum is present,

               Town Council shall adopt its own procedures for conducting meetings of the Town Council.

               of each meeting or workshop of the Town Council shall be properly recorded and open
               to public inspection; however, no official legislative action may be taken in any
               workshop. Sound or video recording may be used to record all proceedings of all public
               meetings from which written minutes shall be transcribed, which such transcribed written
               minutes being a brief summary or series of brief summary of the events of the public
               meeting.

               as one created by the Town Council, at which two (2) or more individual Town Council
               members, or two (2) or more appointed board members, respectively, are present and
               at which official acts, as set forth above, are to be taken, is a public meeting under
               the Florida Sunshine Law. Any Town Council member attending a non-Town Council public
               meeting at which there is discussion regarding items that may foreseeably come before
               the Town Council shall report such discussion at the next Town Council meeting.
A vacancy in office of the Town Council member occurs on death, resignation as of
               the effective date of the resignation, or by resignation caused by the succession
               of a Town Council member to another office. A vacancy also occurs upon resignation
               in a recall pursuant to section 100.361, Fla. Stat. In the event of a vacancy, such
               vacancies shall be filled by appointment by majority vote of the Town Council, and
               such appointment shall continue until the end of the elected term of the dead or resigned
               Town Council member. A Town Council person may be suspended and/or removed from office
               by the Governor pursuant to chapter 112, part V, Fla. Stat., and a suspension by the
               Governor creates a temporary vacancy which shall be filled by appointment by majority
               vote of the Town Council. The appointed person shall hold office for a time period
               equal to the first occurring of the end of the elected term of the suspended person
               or the end of the period of the suspension. No person who has been suspended may perform
               any official act, duty, or function during the suspension, or receive any pay, allowance,
               or emolument during the suspension. Upon conviction as defined in chapter 112, Fla.
               Stat., such person shall be removed from office by the Governor and shall be ineligible
               to again stand for election during the next immediate election. Upon acquittal, the
               Town Council member shall be restored and shall receive back pay only for the elected
               term of office during which the Town Council person was suspended, and if the elected
               term of office has ended, the Town Council member shall not be restored to office
               but may again seek to qualify and stand for election. A vacancy without resignation
               may occur pursuant to the uniform statewide recall provisions of section 100.361,
               Fla. Stat., and said vacancy shall be filled pursuant to section 100.361, Fla. Stat.

               the construction or interpretation of any provision of this charter.

               portions and provisions of this charter.

               the Charter during the period and any corrections made by the town attorney. The pages
               of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into this Code and
               will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete,
               and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, this Code
               will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included
               in the supplement.
In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of this Code which have been
               repealed shall be excluded from this Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.
When preparing a supplement to this Code, the person authorized to prepare the supplement
               may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included
               in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified
               Code. For example, the codifier may:
Organize the ordinance material into appropriate organizational units.
Supply appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for chapters, articles, divisions,
               subdivisions and sections to be included in this Code and make changes in any such
               catchlines, headings and titles or in any such catchlines, headings and titles already
               in this Code.
Assign appropriate numbers to chapters, articles, divisions, subdivisions and sections
               to be added to this Code.
Where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing numbers assigned to chapters,
               articles, divisions, subdivisions or sections.
Change the words "this ordinance" or similar words to "this chapter," "this article,"
               "this division," "this subdivision," "this section" or "sections _____ to _____ "
               (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of this Code that embody the substantive
               sections of the ordinance incorporated in this Code).
Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of the
               ordinances inserted into this Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change
               in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already
               embodied in this Code.
The publisher, editor or codifier shall omit all titles or ordinances; all enacting,
               resolving and repealing clauses, all appropriation measures; all temporary ordinances;
               all declarations of emergency; all validity, declaration of policy and construction
               clauses; except when the retention thereof is necessary to preserve the full meaning
               and intent of the law. Whenever any validity, declaration or policy or construction
               clause is omitted, proper notation of the omission may be made.

               authorized by ordinance.

               an offense, a violation, an infraction, a civil infraction or a misdemeanor by ordinance
               or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance.
In this section, the term "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of
               a town officer or town employee to perform an official duty unless it is specifically
               provided that the failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this
               section.
Except as otherwise provided by law or ordinance, a person convicted of a violation
               of this Code shall be punished:
Pursuant to F.S. ยง 162.22, as it may be amended from time to time, by a fine not to
               exceed that amount set forth by state law, imprisonment for a term not to exceed that
               set forth by state law, or any combination thereof.
Pursuant to F.S. ยง 162.21, as it may be amended from time to time, by a civil penalty
               not to exceed that amount set forth by state law.
Pursuant to F.S. ยง 162.09, as it may be amended from time to time, if enforcement
               is by the code enforcement board or a special magistrate, by a fine that shall not
               exceed those amounts set forth by state law for a first violation, for a repeat violation
               and per violation if the code enforcement board or special magistrate finds the violation
               to be irreparable or irreversible in nature. Such fines for each day the violation
               continues past the date set by the enforcement board or special magistrate for compliance
               or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues,
               beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code
               enforcement board or special magistrate.
Any combination of the above.
With respect to violations that are continuous with respect to time, each day the
               violation continues is a separate violation constituting a separate offense.
The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not prevent the
               revocation or suspension of any license, franchise or permit issued or granted under
               the provisions of this Code.

Creation of alternate code enforcement system.There is hereby created, pursuant to F.S. ยง 162.03(2), an alternate code enforcement
               system. This alternate code enforcement system shall have the same status as a code
               enforcement board. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the town from enforcing
               any ordinance or code through a court of competent jurisdiction.
Creation and purpose of special magistrates and alternate special magistrates.There is hereby created a code enforcement system which utilizes special magistrates,
               each of whom is to be appointed by the town council. Special magistrates shall have
               the authority to conduct hearings to determine whether a violation of any code or
               an ordinance of the town within the special magistrate jurisdiction has occurred and
               upon finding that a violation has occurred, impose fines, costs and liens against

               to hear cases in which a special magistrate has a conflict or is unavailable for scheduled
               code enforcement hearings or an emergency code enforcement hearing.
Qualifications of a special magistrate.All magistrates shall be attorneys who are in good standing with the Florida Bar.
               Those attorneys should possess an outstanding reputation for business and professional
               ability, civic pride and community development. The clerical staff of the code enforcement
               system shall process all applications for appointment.
Term of service; removal.All special magistrates and alternate special magistrates shall be appointed for
               a term of two years and may be reappointed by the town council. Despite the term for
               which they were appointed, all magistrates serve at the pleasure of the town council
               and are not employees of the town. If any magistrate fails to attend two of three
               successive hearings without good cause, the position shall be considered vacant, and
               the town council shall promptly fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In addition,
               the town council may contract with an entity or agency including, without limitation,
               a law office or law firm to provide a special magistrate or alternate special magistrate
               who meets the qualifications of this division.
Clerical and administrative support staff.The town council shall provide clerical and administrative support to the magistrates
               as may be reasonably required for the proper performance of their duties.

               have jurisdiction over alleged violations involving all real property except that
               which is a homestead under section 4, article X, of the Florida Constitution, at the
               time of the alleged violation.
Orders existing prior to the creation of the code enforcement special magistrate system.All orders or decisions of any authorized entity within the town prior to the effective
               date of the ordinance from which this article is derived remain in full force and
               effect. Special magistrates shall have the authority to affirm, ratify, or amend any
               order, including orders imposing fines as liens, or decision rendered or imposed by
               any authorized entity within the town prior to the effective date of the ordinance

               submit evidence, make legal arguments on behalf of the town and exercise any and all
               other powers necessary to prosecute violations within the jurisdiction of the special

Sec. 2-80. - Enforcement procedure of code enforcement special magistrates.


Initiation of proceedings.It shall be the duty of the code enforcement officer to initiate enforcement proceedings
               of the various codes. No magistrate shall have the power to initiate such proceedings.
Notification of violations.Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a violation of
               a code or ordinance is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator
               and provide a reasonable time to correct the violation. If the violation is corrected
               and then recurs on any property owned by the alleged violator or if the violation
               is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code enforcement officer,
               the case shall be presented to the code enforcement special magistrate even if the
               violation has been corrected prior to the hearing. Written notice of the violation
               and hearing shall be given in accordance with this article. If the violation is corrected
               and then recurs within five years on any property owned by the alleged violator after
               the hearing date, the case shall be presented to the special magistrate, upon notifying
               the alleged violator of the recurrence of the violation and hearing date, without
               any additional time to correct the violation.
Repeat violations.If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator
               but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation.
               The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall
               notify the clerical staff of the special magistrate and request a hearing. The clerical
               staff shall schedule a hearing. Written notice of such hearing shall be given in accordance
               with this article. The case may be presented to the magistrate even if the repeat
               violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state.
               If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement special magistrate
               retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment
               of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose
               to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the
               magistrate.
Serious or irreparable violations.If the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition
               causing the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement
               officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately
               notify the special magistrate and request a hearing.
Transfer of ownership.If the owner of the property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before
               a special magistrate or court transfers ownership of such property between the time
               the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall:
Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective
               transferee.
Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of all pleadings, notices, and other
               materials received by the owner/transferor in connection with the code enforcement
               proceeding.
Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible
               for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement
               proceeding.
File a notice with the code enforcement special magistrate informing the magistrate
               of the transfer of the subject property, with the identity and address of the new
               owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after
               the date of the transfer.

               the date, time and location of the hearing and shall generally set forth the nature
               of the alleged violation with reference to the relevant code or ordinance. Notice
               shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, hand delivery, posting
               or publication. The method of providing notice shall be the option of the code enforcement
               division.
Attempts of notice.Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail the notice, as provided
               for in this section, together with proof of publication or posting, shall be sufficient

Sec. 2-82. - Conduct of special magistrate hearings.


Frequency of hearings.The special magistrate shall hold code enforcement hearings as necessary. Any hearing
               of a special magistrate may be called at the request of the special magistrate or
               the town manager.
Notice.Upon scheduling of a hearing before the special magistrate, the town shall cause
               written notice to be delivered to the alleged violator as prescribed in this article.
Burden of proof.At the initial hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the town to show by a preponderance
               of the evidence that a violation exists. At hearings subsequent to the initial hearing,
               the burden of proof shall be upon the moving party and all allegations should be proven
               by a preponderance of the evidence.
Hearings in the absence of the violator.Provided that proper notice of a hearing has been served upon the alleged violator,
               a hearing may proceed in the absence of the alleged violator.
Representation of violator.The alleged violator may be represented by counsel or any other person at any hearing.
Representation by an attorney.If the violator is represented by counsel authorized to practice law in the state,
               then that attorney shall file a notice of appearance with the town clerk.
Representation by an individual who is not an attorney.If the violator is represented at any hearing by someone other than a Florida-licensed
               attorney, then the alleged violator must prepare a notarized statement that authorizes
               such person to speak as a representative, file the statement with the town clerk.
               If the statement is not received by the town clerk prior to the hearing, the hearing
               will continue as if the violator is not present or represented. By providing a notarized
               statement, the violator understands and agrees that the representative shall have
               the authority to agree that a violation exists, to agree to the imposition of a fine
               or lien upon the violator's property, and to bind the violator to remedy a violation.
               If an alleged violator provides written authorization for a representative, the violator
               cannot later assert or complain that the representative acted without authority, nor
               can the violator contest the representative's actions.
Presentation to a magistrate.The parties shall be permitted to present brief opening and closing statements. All
               testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The magistrate shall take testimony
               from the code enforcement officer, the alleged violator and any other witnesses either
               party may call. The parties, the authorized representatives of the parties, the magistrate,
               and the town attorney or his designee, may be permitted to inquire of any witnesses.
Submission of evidence.The parties may submit evidence to the magistrate. Formal rules of evidence shall
               not apply; however, fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern all
               proceedings. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded,
               but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons
               in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence
               would be admissible in a trial in the courts of the state.
Magistrate's determination.At the conclusion of the hearing, the special magistrate shall issue findings of
               fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order
               based upon such findings. The order may include a specified date by which the violator
               must comply and that a fine may be imposed. Notwithstanding that a fine or lien has
               been imposed, the town may seek additional relief against a violator who has failed
               to comply with a magistrate's order. A magistrate may issue any order giving relief
               that would bring about compliance, which may include the town's authorization to remedy
               the violations on the violator's behalf regardless of whether the violation creates
               a public nuisance.
Magistrate's order.The costs of remedying violations on a violator's behalf shall be included along
               with the fine if the violator fails to correct the violations as ordered. The order
               must include a statement that any person aggrieved by the order who was a party below
               may appeal in accordance with this ordinance. A certified copy of such order may be
               recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent
               purchasers, successors, and assigns if the violation concerns real property. The findings
               therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property,
               any subsequent purchasers, successors and assigns. If an order is recorded in the
               public records pursuant to this section and the order is complied with by the date
               specified in the order, the special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging
               compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required
               to issue such an order acknowledging compliance.
Costs of prosecution.If the town prevails in prosecuting a case before a special magistrate, the town
               shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case, including
               without limitation, all vendor, administrative, and operating costs, and such costs
               shall be included in the lien authorized under this division.
In those instances where the violation is not corrected by the time specified for
               correction by the code enforcement officer, the town shall be entitled to recover
               all costs incurred in prosecuting the case, including without limitation, all vendor,
               administrative, and operating costs, and such costs shall be included in the lien
               authorized under this article.
In those instances where the violation is corrected and them recurs within five years
               on any property owned or occupied by the alleged violator, the town shall be entitled
               to recover all costs reasonably and necessarily incurred by the town for the original
               violation and recurrence of the violation, including without limitation, all vendor,
               administrative, and operating costs, and such costs shall be imposed against the violator
               at a hearing in which notice has been sent to the violator even if the violation is
               corrected prior to the hearing and such costs shall be included in the lien authorized
               under this article.
Violation of a special magistrate's cease and desist order.It shall be a violation of this article, punishable in accordance with F.S. ยง 125.69,
               as it may be amended from time to time, for any person to violate a cease and desist
               order issued by a special magistrate or appellate special magistrate. Any person who
               has been sent such order by regular mail, has been given a copy of such order by hand
               delivery from a code inspector, law enforcement officer, or certified process server,
               or is on property posted with a copy of the order shall be deemed to have knowledge
               of such order and subject to prosecution of violation of this division in accordance
               with F.S. ยง 125.69, as it may be amended from time to time. A violation of this article
               shall be considered a violation of town ordinance and shall be prosecuted in the same
               manner as misdemeanors are prosecuted in accordance with F.S. ยง 125.69, as it may
               be amended from time to time.

               Circuit with venue in Madison County. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the
               execution of the written order to be appealed and shall be subject to the Florida
               Rules of Appellate Procedure, as they may be amended from time to time.

--------------------------------------------------
Sec. 2-84. - Administrative fines, costs of repairs, costs to the town, and liens.


Authorization of administrative fines and costs of repairs.A magistrate, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that an order of
               the special magistrate has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding
               that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in
               an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the
               date set by the code enforcement special magistrate for compliance, or in the case
               of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with
               the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In
               addition, if the violation is not remedied by the violator as ordered and the town
               is authorized to remedy such violation, the magistrate may charge the violator with
               the reasonable costs of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section.
               Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the town
               to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability
               against the town for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in
               good faith. If a finding of a violation or repeat violation has been made according
               to this article, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing
               the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, a magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable
               or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in
               subsection (b) of this section.
Amount of fine.The special magistrate is hereby authorized to impose a fine for a first violation,
               for a repeat violation and if the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable
               or irreversible in nature in the amounts set forth in F.S. ยง 162.09(2)(a), as it may
               be amended from time to time. In addition to such fines, the special magistrate shall
               impose additional fines to cover all costs incurred by town in enforcing its codes
               and all costs or repairs made pursuant to an order issued by the special magistrate.
               In determining the amount of the fines for violations, the special magistrate shall
               consider:
The gravity of the violation;
Any actions taken by the violator; and
Any previous violations committed by the violator.
Creation of lien.A certified copy of an order imposing a fine or imposing a fine with costs of repairs
               may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against
               the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property
               owned by the violator. The order imposing a fine may include costs of repairs made
               on the violator's behalf by the town and any costs incurred by the town in relation
               to the investigation and prosecution of said violation. Upon petition to the circuit
               court of the Third Judicial Circuit, in and for Madison County, such order shall be
               enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state,
               including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such
               order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes.
               A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator
               comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to this
               section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this
               section runs in favor of the town and a magistrate may execute a satisfaction or release
               of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any
               such lien which remains unpaid, the town council may authorize the town attorney to
               foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the
               lien plus accrued interest.
Duration of lien.No lien imposed pursuant to this article shall continue for a period longer than
               20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless
               within that time an action to foreclose is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction.
               In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party
               is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs
               as a result of this action. The town shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred
               in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by
               the commencement of this action shall not be good creditors or subsequent purchasers
               for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

               separate revenue account, which is hereby created. Said account shall be known as

               the imposition of any liens on personal and real property resulting from Code violations,
               are hereby ratified and confirmed. The code enforcement special magistrates are hereby

Sec. 2-76. - Code enforcement special magistrate system.


Creation of alternate code enforcement system.There is hereby created, pursuant to F.S. ยง 162.03(2), an alternate code enforcement
               system. This alternate code enforcement system shall have the same status as a code
               enforcement board. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the town from enforcing
               any ordinance or code through a court of competent jurisdiction.
Creation and purpose of special magistrates and alternate special magistrates.There is hereby created a code enforcement system which utilizes special magistrates,
               each of whom is to be appointed by the town council. Special magistrates shall have
               the authority to conduct hearings to determine whether a violation of any code or
               an ordinance of the town within the special magistrate jurisdiction has occurred and
               upon finding that a violation has occurred, impose fines, costs and liens against
               the violators. In addition, the town council may appoint alternate special magistrates
               to hear cases in which a special magistrate has a conflict or is unavailable for scheduled
               code enforcement hearings or an emergency code enforcement hearing.
Qualifications of a special magistrate.All magistrates shall be attorneys who are in good standing with the Florida Bar.
               Those attorneys should possess an outstanding reputation for business and professional
               ability, civic pride and community development. The clerical staff of the code enforcement
               system shall process all applications for appointment.
Term of service; removal.All special magistrates and alternate special magistrates shall be appointed for
               a term of two years and may be reappointed by the town council. Despite the term for
               which they were appointed, all magistrates serve at the pleasure of the town council
               and are not employees of the town. If any magistrate fails to attend two of three
               successive hearings without good cause, the position shall be considered vacant, and
               the town council shall promptly fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In addition,
               the town council may contract with an entity or agency including, without limitation,
               a law office or law firm to provide a special magistrate or alternate special magistrate
               who meets the qualifications of this division.
Clerical and administrative support staff.The town council shall provide clerical and administrative support to the magistrates
               as may be reasonably required for the proper performance of their duties.

Sec. 2-77. - Jurisdiction of code enforcement special magistrates.


General jurisdiction.Code enforcement special magistrates shall have the jurisdiction to hear any alleged
               violation of any code or ordinance of the town that does not provide for an exclusive
               method of enforcement through other means. Code enforcement special magistrates shall
               have jurisdiction over alleged violations involving all real property except that
               which is a homestead under section 4, article X, of the Florida Constitution, at the
               time of the alleged violation.
Orders existing prior to the creation of the code enforcement special magistrate system.All orders or decisions of any authorized entity within the town prior to the effective
               date of the ordinance from which this article is derived remain in full force and
               effect. Special magistrates shall have the authority to affirm, ratify, or amend any
               order, including orders imposing fines as liens, or decision rendered or imposed by
               any authorized entity within the town prior to the effective date of the ordinance
               from which this article is derived.

                  shall be approved by the town council.

                  sheriff of the county.

               submit evidence, make legal arguments on behalf of the town and exercise any and all
               other powers necessary to prosecute violations within the jurisdiction of the special

Sec. 2-80. - Enforcement procedure of code enforcement special magistrates.


Initiation of proceedings.It shall be the duty of the code enforcement officer to initiate enforcement proceedings
               of the various codes. No magistrate shall have the power to initiate such proceedings.
Notification of violations.Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a violation of
               a code or ordinance is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator
               and provide a reasonable time to correct the violation. If the violation is corrected
               and then recurs on any property owned by the alleged violator or if the violation
               is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code enforcement officer,
               the case shall be presented to the code enforcement special magistrate even if the
               violation has been corrected prior to the hearing. Written notice of the violation
               and hearing shall be given in accordance with this article. If the violation is corrected
               and then recurs within five years on any property owned by the alleged violator after
               the hearing date, the case shall be presented to the special magistrate, upon notifying
               the alleged violator of the recurrence of the violation and hearing date, without
               any additional time to correct the violation.
Repeat violations.If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator
               but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation.
               The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall
               notify the clerical staff of the special magistrate and request a hearing. The clerical
               staff shall schedule a hearing. Written notice of such hearing shall be given in accordance
               with this article. The case may be presented to the magistrate even if the repeat
               violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state.
               If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement special magistrate
               retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment
               of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose
               to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the
               magistrate.
Serious or irreparable violations.If the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition
               causing the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement
               officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately
               notify the special magistrate and request a hearing.
Transfer of ownership.If the owner of the property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before
               a special magistrate or court transfers ownership of such property between the time
               the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall:
Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective
               transferee.
Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of all pleadings, notices, and other
               materials received by the owner/transferor in connection with the code enforcement
               proceeding.
Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible
               for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement
               proceeding.
File a notice with the code enforcement special magistrate informing the magistrate
               of the transfer of the subject property, with the identity and address of the new
               owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after
               the date of the transfer.

--------------------------------------------------
Sec. 2-82. - Conduct of special magistrate hearings.


Frequency of hearings.The special magistrate shall hold code enforcement hearings as necessary. Any hearing
               of a special magistrate may be called at the request of the special magistrate or
               the town manager.
Notice.Upon scheduling of a hearing before the special magistrate, the town shall cause
               written notice to be delivered to the alleged violator as prescribed in this article.
Burden of proof.At the initial hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the town to show by a preponderance
               of the evidence that a violation exists. At hearings subsequent to the initial hearing,
               the burden of proof shall be upon the moving party and all allegations should be proven
               by a preponderance of the evidence.
Hearings in the absence of the violator.Provided that proper notice of a hearing has been served upon the alleged violator,
               a hearing may proceed in the absence of the alleged violator.
Representation of violator.The alleged violator may be represented by counsel or any other person at any hearing.
Representation by an attorney.If the violator is represented by counsel authorized to practice law in the state,
               then that attorney shall file a notice of appearance with the town clerk.
Representation by an individual who is not an attorney.If the violator is represented at any hearing by someone other than a Florida-licensed
               attorney, then the alleged violator must prepare a notarized statement that authorizes
               such person to speak as a representative, file the statement with the town clerk.
               If the statement is not received by the town clerk prior to the hearing, the hearing
               will continue as if the violator is not present or represented. By providing a notarized
               statement, the violator understands and agrees that the representative shall have
               the authority to agree that a violation exists, to agree to the imposition of a fine
               or lien upon the violator's property, and to bind the violator to remedy a violation.
               If an alleged violator provides written authorization for a representative, the violator
               cannot later assert or complain that the representative acted without authority, nor
               can the violator contest the representative's actions.
Presentation to a magistrate.The parties shall be permitted to present brief opening and closing statements. All
               testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The magistrate shall take testimony
               from the code enforcement officer, the alleged violator and any other witnesses either
               party may call. The parties, the authorized representatives of the parties, the magistrate,
               and the town attorney or his designee, may be permitted to inquire of any witnesses.
Submission of evidence.The parties may submit evidence to the magistrate. Formal rules of evidence shall
               not apply; however, fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern all
               proceedings. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded,
               but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons
               in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence
               would be admissible in a trial in the courts of the state.
Magistrate's determination.At the conclusion of the hearing, the special magistrate shall issue findings of
               fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order
               based upon such findings. The order may include a specified date by which the violator
               must comply and that a fine may be imposed. Notwithstanding that a fine or lien has
               been imposed, the town may seek additional relief against a violator who has failed
               to comply with a magistrate's order. A magistrate may issue any order giving relief
               that would bring about compliance, which may include the town's authorization to remedy
               the violations on the violator's behalf regardless of whether the violation creates
               a public nuisance.
Magistrate's order.The costs of remedying violations on a violator's behalf shall be included along
               with the fine if the violator fails to correct the violations as ordered. The order
               must include a statement that any person aggrieved by the order who was a party below

               violation and recurrence of the violation, including without limitation, all vendor,

Sec. 2-84. - Administrative fines, costs of repairs, costs to the town, and liens.


Authorization of administrative fines and costs of repairs.A magistrate, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that an order of
               the special magistrate has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding
               that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in
               an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the
               date set by the code enforcement special magistrate for compliance, or in the case
               of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with
               the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In
               addition, if the violation is not remedied by the violator as ordered and the town
               is authorized to remedy such violation, the magistrate may charge the violator with
               the reasonable costs of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section.
               Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the town
               to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability
               against the town for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in
               good faith. If a finding of a violation or repeat violation has been made according
               to this article, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing
               the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, a magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable
               or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in
               subsection (b) of this section.
Amount of fine.The special magistrate is hereby authorized to impose a fine for a first violation,
               for a repeat violation and if the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable
               or irreversible in nature in the amounts set forth in F.S. ยง 162.09(2)(a), as it may
               be amended from time to time. In addition to such fines, the special magistrate shall
               impose additional fines to cover all costs incurred by town in enforcing its codes
               and all costs or repairs made pursuant to an order issued by the special magistrate.
               In determining the amount of the fines for violations, the special magistrate shall
               consider:
The gravity of the violation;
Any actions taken by the violator; and
Any previous violations committed by the violator.
Creation of lien.A certified copy of an order imposing a fine or imposing a fine with costs of repairs
               may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against
               the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property
               owned by the violator. The order imposing a fine may include costs of repairs made
               on the violator's behalf by the town and any costs incurred by the town in relation
               to the investigation and prosecution of said violation. Upon petition to the circuit
               court of the Third Judicial Circuit, in and for Madison County, such order shall be
               enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state,
               including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such
               order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes.
               A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator
               comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to this
               section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this
               section runs in favor of the town and a magistrate may execute a satisfaction or release
               of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any
               such lien which remains unpaid, the town council may authorize the town attorney to
               foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the
               lien plus accrued interest.
Duration of lien.No lien imposed pursuant to this article shall continue for a period longer than
               20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless
               within that time an action to foreclose is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction.
               In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party
               is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs
               as a result of this action. The town shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred
               in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by
               the commencement of this action shall not be good creditors or subsequent purchasers
               for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

               separate revenue account, which is hereby created. Said account shall be known as

               has occurred and can be resolved by conciliation, he shall attempt to conciliate the
               matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all the interested parties

               alleged discriminatory housing practice has been committed, the administrator shall
               take no further action with respect to the alleged offense.
If the administrator, with respect to any matter which involves a contravention of

               and its impact on the town's sewer system is consistent with normal domestic wastewater,
               then the above impact fees shall apply. The town shall have the right to require an
               industrial user to enter into a contract with the town for such impact fees.
Provided, however, nothing herein shall be deemed to change the moratorium on impact
               fees adopted by the town council in Ord. No. 235 passed on July 14, 2014. Such moratorium
               shall remain in place until specifically lifted by the town council.

               result in sewage disposal of wastewater to the town's sewer system shall not be obligated
               to pay the sewer or impact fees in this section.
