2. I did not get to finish implementing the tree structure. If I had more time, I would use the delimiters I had in place to construct each TreeNode. I added these to the txt file while writing to it to make it easier to split each section and have an easy to follow way of constructing the tree as well as traversing through it. I had created a TreeNode class where the constructor would take in text for that node and would have a list of children. Since this is essentially an N-ary tree since there's no specific bound on the number of children each Node will have, we must construct the tree in this manner. I created a root code with the text "Ordinance" and would have each section/chapter by a child of this root node. From there, I would use my delmiters while reading in the text file to extract each subsection as well as their description. The subsection would be a child of the section and the desciption would be a child of the subsection. This would make it simple to traverse through this tree and extract the desired text. To traverse for text, I would prompt the user to input the section, locate that section, then prompt them to input a subsection, locate that subsection, and then output the description.


3. For the final task of looping over each town and showing that the code works, I would replace the section_urls dictionary with the respective sections and urls for each section and then scrape using them.
